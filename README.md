# winner-winner

Winner Winner is a simple CL application I'm building to practice using Python for the first time. The idea is for my wife to use it to track social media giveaway campaigns. When finished, it will allow her to add new campaigns and add entries within those campaigns, then select one or more winners when the giveaway has ended.
